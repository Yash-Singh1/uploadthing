## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    {/* <!-- prettier-ignore --> */}
    ```bash copy

```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

When using Uploadthing with React Native, we assume that you already setup an API route by following one of the Next.js or Solid Start guides to do so.

## Using the FileRouter

The `@uploadthing/react-native` package contains two components `ImageUploader` and `DocumentUploader`. For an example of using `create-t3-turbo` with UploadThing, see the [example](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples/react-native).

### ImageUploader

```tsx copy
import { type OurFileRouter } from "@acme/nextjs/src/app/api/uploadthing/core";
import { ImageUploader } from "@uploadthing/react-native";
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context";
import { getBaseUrl } from "~/utils/api";

const Index = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView className="bg-[#1F104A]">
      <View className="h-full w-full p-4">
        <ImageUploader<OurFileRouter>
          endpoint="imageUploader"
          onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
            console.log(res);
          }}
          showPreview={true}
          onUploadError={(err) => {
            console.error(err);
          }}
          url={`${getBaseUrl()}/api/uploadthing`}
        />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default Index;
```

#### Props

##### `endpoint`

Type: `string`

The `endpoint` prop configures what endpoint to upload the input to. It is recommended that when using `ImageUploader`, the endpoint allows images and/or videos.

##### `multiple`

Type: `boolean`

This boolean configures whether the image picker has the ability to select multiple images/videos.

##### `allowEditing`

Type: `boolean`

The `allowEditing` prop configures whether the user can edit the image/video prior to uploading. This is enabled by default on IPads to fix a bug on IPad Pro when working with image pickers.

##### `showPreview`

Type: `boolean`

Whether or not to show a preview of the image uploaded. You cannot show a preview for videos or when `multiple` is enabled.

##### `onClientUploadComplete`

Type: `Function`

The `onClientUploadComplete` callback is fired once the client receives information on the completion of the upload.

##### `onUploadError`

Type: `Function`

The `onUploadError` callback is fired whenever there is an error in the uploading process.

##### `url`

Type: `String`

The `url` prop configures the API route that you hosted for UploadThing.

##### `theme`

Type: `object`

The `theme` prop configures the theming of the component.

import { type OurFileRouter } from "@acme/nextjs/src/app/api/uploadthing/core";

        <DocumentUploader<OurFileRouter>
          endpoint="blobUploader"
          onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
            console.log(res);
          }}
